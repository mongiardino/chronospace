## `chronospace`: statistical exploration of time-calibrated phylogenies and the relative impact of methodological decisions.


<img src="man/figures/chronospace_hex.png" align="right" width="200"/>


Calibrating phylogenies to absolute time is a complex and time-consuming, yet crucial step in macroevolutionary analysis. Bayesian approaches to time scaling phylogenetic trees have dramatically grown in complexity, and hinge today upon numerous methodological choices (e.g., gene sampling strategy, type of clock, model of molecular evolution, prior on divergence times, set of fossil calibrations, etc.) that can be difficult to justify. As a consequence, divergence times are routinely inferred under a limited range of parametric conditions, often chosen arbitrarily. Attempts to measure and summarize the sensitivity of results to such decisions often rely on tables with node ages or plotting multiple consensus trees which are cumbersome to interpret, and lack a consistent way to quantify (and therefore to compare) their effect.

`chronospace` is an R package devised to help visualizing and quantifying the sensitivity of results to methodological decisions through the use of chronospaces, i.e., graphical representations summarizing variation in the node ages contained in time-calibrated trees with fixed topology. In particular, this package uses between-groups PCA (bgPCA) for summarizing variation in node ages produced by specific methodological choices, and estimates their impact using a Sum of squares (SSQ) approach for measuring effect size. Visualization of chronospaces is and other graphical tools included in `chronospace` are built with the aid of `ggplot2` (Wickham 2016), `ggtree` (Yu 2017) and `deeptime` (Gearty 2023), among others packages.

**Note: this repository addresses the version of `chronospace` described in Mongiardino Koch and Milla Carmona (in preparation). If you are interested in the data and procedures described in Mongiardino Koch et al. 2022 eLife paper (on which this version of the package is based), go to the [chronospaces_eLife repository](https://github.com/mongiardino/chronospaces_eLife/tree/main)**
  
  
## Installation
The development version of `chronospace` can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mongiardino/chronospace")
```

## The data set
Below, the capabilities of `chronospace` are showcased using the [echinoid data set](https://github.com/mongiardino/chronospaces_eLife/tree/main/example_files) described in [Mongiardino Koch et al. 2022](https://elifesciences.org/articles/72460), comprised of six posterior distributions of time-calibrated trees obtained using PhyloBayes (Lartillot et al. 2013). These were all run using the same constrained topology (as required by the `chronospace` suite of functions), but varying two methodological decisions:

1) **Gene subsampling strategy**: three different sets of 100 genes, subsampled from a larger phylogenomic data set based on their level of clock-likeness or phylogenetic signal, or otherwise at random, were assessed. 

2) **Model of molecular evolution**: each gene subsample was also run under two models of molecular evolution, the site-homogeneous GTR+G and the site-heterogeneous CAT+GTR+G (Lartillot & Philippe 2004). 

This setting will allow us to evaluate whether inferred ages are more sensitive to the choice of loci or to the choice of model of molecular evolution. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Create temporal directory for downloading the files
temp0 <- tempdir()
dir.create(paste(temp0, "files", sep = "/"))
temp <- paste(temp0, "files", sep = "/")

#Declare and download files from the internet (this might take a minute)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongiardino/chronospaces_eLife/main/example_files/"
files <- c("clockCATGTR_ln_sample.datedist",
            "clockGTR_ln_sample.datedist",
            "randomCATGTR_ln_sample.datedist",
            "randomGTR_ln_sample.datedist",
            "signalCATGTR_ln_sample.datedist",
            "signalGTR_ln_sample.datedist")
for(i in 1:length(files)) download.file(paste0(url, files[i]), paste(temp, files[i], sep = "/"))
```


## Importing and formatting node ages data
The `extract_ages` function imports the input data from a series of external `.tre` or `.datedist` files (these can be either different runs of the same analysis or separate analyses), containing trees in Newick format and stored together in an exclusive folder.

`extract_ages` has two main arguments: `type` - a list of vectors, one for each factor being tested (in this case two, loci choice and model of evolution), specifying the group (i.e., factor levels) to which the chronograms from each file will be assigned to (in this case, three groups for loci choice and two for model of evolution); and `sample` - the fixed number of topologies to retain from each file (here we will sample 500 trees from each file for a total of 3000 trees). 

**Note: `extract_ages` will import the files in the order they appear in the folder; the list provided in `type` must follow this same order**


```{r}
#load chronospace
library(chronospace)

#Important! Check files names, compare against type order below
list.files(temp)

#Set type of runs and number of chronograms to be retained. Name the listed 
#elements in type to change factor names:
type <- list(loci = c('clock', 'clock', 'random', 'random', 'signal', 'signal'),
             model = c('CATGTR', 'GTR', 'CATGTR', 'GTR', 'CATGTR', 'GTR'))
sample <- 500

#Import data to R (this might take a minute)
data <- extract_ages(path = temp, type = type, sample = sample)
```

The function will organize these files into an object of class `"nodeAges"`, containing 1) a table where each cell represents the estimated age of a particular node in a particular tree from the posterior distribution, 2) a data frame where each methodological choice is coded as a separate factor, and 3) the fixed topology. 

```{r}
#Print nodeAges object
data


```

## Summarizing chronospaces
The node ages data stored in `"nodeAges"` objects can be summarized using the `chronospace` function, which uses bgPCA to find the major directions of variation between groups - i.e., the different alternatives (levels; e.g., GTR+G vs CAT+GTR+G) associated to a particular methodological choice (factor; e.g., model of evolution). The function reports the percentage of variation explained by each factor, both in relation to the total amount of variation in node ages and for each individual bgPC extracted. This information can be used to gauge the relative importance of each choice over node age estimation.

```{r}
#Summarize chronospace
cspace <- chronospace(data)


```

Chronospaces can be also assessed using visualization tools. The `plot` function can be used to display scatter plots (when there are three or more groups) or histograms (when there are only two groups), depicting the distribution of trees in the space configured by bgPC axes:
  
```{r}
#Plot scatterplot for loci
plot(cspace, factor = 1, output = "ordination")

#Plot histogram for model
plot(cspace, factor = 2, output = "ordination")

```

Another graphical output of feeding a `"nodeAges"` object to `plot` are pairs of chronograms showing the change in node ages at the extremes of bgPC axes. Change is represented by color-coding branches according to their degree of contraction/expansion along the different bgPCA axis to get a sense of how these different node ages are realized:
  
```{r}
#Plot between-models PC1 extremes 
plot(cspace, factor = 1, output = "extremes")
```


## Dissecting the effect of methodological choices
`"nodeAges"` objects can also be fed to a number of functions that help characterizing the impact of methodological choices over particular aspects of evolutionary history. 

`sensitive_nodes` plots the age distribution of the nodes whose ages vary the most when a particular methodological choice is faced. The user can either ask for a given number of most affected nodes, or specify a threshold for the amount of change above which nodes are considered to be relevant (arguments `amount_of_change` and `num_clades`, respectively). 

```{r}
#Plot the ages distribution of the three nodes most affected by the model of 
#evolution chosen 
sensitive_nodes(echinoid_dates, num_clades = 3, factor = 2)
```

`specified_nodes` produces a similar output, but instead of showing the most affected nodes it displays the ages distribution of a particular node of interest specified by the user through the argument `tips` (the function will find the most recent common ancestor between two chosen tips).

```{r}
#Plot the ages distribution of the MRCA of Brissus obesus and Abatus cordatus
#under different loci subsampling strategies
specified_node(echinoid_dates, factor = 1, 
               tips = c('Brissus_obesus', 'Abatus_cordatus'))
```

Finally, `ltt_sensitivity` allows exploring the impact of methodological choices on diversification rates by displaying separate lineage-through-time curves for each group from a particular factor. Averaging node ages across subsamples of chronograms can be computed using either the mean or the median (argument `summary`)

```{r}
#Plot lineage through time plots for each model of evolution
ltt_sensitivity(echinoid_dates, factor = 1, summary = "median")
```
