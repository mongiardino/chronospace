\title{Extract and organize ages data}
\usage{
extract_ages2(path = NA, type, sample)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string specifying the path to the folder containing
(only) the input files.}

\item{type}{A list of \code{f} vectors (one for each factor being tested)
specifying the group to which the chronograms from each file will be
assigned to.}

\item{sample}{The fixed number of trees to retain from each file.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"dataAges"} with a list containing 1) the
\code{t x n} ages matrix (where each row is one of \code{t} trees and each
column one of \code{n} nodes), 2) the \code{f} associated factors, and 3)
the fixed phylogenetic topology.
}
\description{
Extract and organize ages from files containing the posterior
distributions of time-calibrated phylogenetic trees (i.e. chronograms)
obtained through different methodological decisions.
}
\details{
This function imports and prepare the ages data such that they are
suitable for analysis using chronospace. The input files are a series of
files in Newick format containing time-calibrated trees taken from the
posterior distributions of separate Bayesian inferences of the same dataset
(can be either different runs of the same analysis or separate analyses).
These should differ in specific aspects of their initial setting whose
effects are of interest (e.g. the model of evolution used and/or the method
employed to subsample genes) and be stored in an exclusive folder. The
topology is assumed constrained, such that chronograms differ only in the
branch lengths (and therefore, in their inferred node ages).
